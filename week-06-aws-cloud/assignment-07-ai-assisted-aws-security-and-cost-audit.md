# Assignment 7 — AI-Assisted AWS Security and Cost Audit

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash script that audits the AWS resources you deployed earlier this week — your S3 static site, EC2 instance(s), security groups, RDS database, and EBS volumes — for common security and cost misconfigurations. You will then connect that script to Claude Code as a reusable `/aws-audit` skill that explains what it found and recommends a fix, without ever making the fix itself. Finally, you will find a real misconfiguration in your own account, apply the fix yourself, and prove it worked with a second audit run.

# Task 1 — Confirm Your AWS Resources and Set Up Your Workspace

## Goal

Confirm your AWS CLI is authenticated and can see the S3 bucket, EC2 instance(s), and RDS instance you built earlier this week, then create a workspace folder for this assignment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing your AWS identity and your S3, EC2, and RDS resources listed

---

# Task 2 — Define Safety Rules in CLAUDE.md

## Goal

Create a `CLAUDE.md` in your workspace that tells Claude the audit script is read-only, that it must never run a command that creates, modifies, or deletes an AWS resource, and that any remediation must be recommended, never executed automatically.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `CLAUDE.md` open showing the project overview and safety rules

# Task 3 — Plan the Audit with Claude Code

## Goal

Ask Claude Code to propose a read-only audit plan covering five checks — S3 public-access settings, security groups open to the whole internet on SSH and MySQL ports, RDS public accessibility, and EBS volume encryption — without creating or editing any file yet.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Claude's proposed five-check audit plan

![output ](screenshots/A7Screenshot3.png)

---

# Task 4 — Build the AWS Audit Script

## Goal

Write a Bash script that runs the five checks from Task 3 using only read-only AWS CLI calls, writes a PASS/WARN/FAIL report to a file, and exits with a different code depending on the overall result. Make it executable and confirm it has no syntax errors.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — The script open in your editor, showing the checks and the report logic

![output ](screenshots/A7Screenshot4.png)

---

# Task 5 — Run the Baseline Audit

## Goal

Run the script against your live AWS account and review the report honestly, noting any PASS, WARN, or FAIL result before you change anything.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Script output showing your Full Name and all five check results

![output ](screenshots/A7Screenshot5.png)

---

# Task 6 — Build and Run the /aws-audit Skill

## Goal

Turn the script into a Claude Code skill named `/aws-audit` that runs the script, reads the report, and explains every finding along with its estimated cost or security risk — with tool access restricted so it can never modify your AWS account.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Skill file showing the restricted tool access

![output ](screenshots/A7Screenshot6.png)

---

#### Screenshot 7 — `/aws-audit` output showing the findings and Claude's recommendation

![output ](screenshots/A7Screenshot7.png)

# Task 7 — Fix a Real Finding and Re-Verify

## Goal

Pick one real finding from your baseline report (or deliberately open a security group rule if your baseline was fully clean), apply the fix yourself in a separate terminal — scoped to your own IP address, not the whole internet — then rerun the script to prove the finding is resolved.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Terminal output of the remediation command you ran yourself

![output ](screenshots/A7Screenshot8.png)

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Second script run showing the finding now passing

![output ](screenshots/A7Screenshot9.png)

---

### Notes

Map this assignment to Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify: which step did the script perform, which did Claude perform, and why must the remediation command always be run by you and never by Claude?

### Notes

Map this assignment to Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify: which step did the script perform, which did Claude perform, and why must the remediation command always be run by you and never by Claude?

## Notes — Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify

This assignment followed the **Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify** workflow.

* **Gather:** The read-only Bash audit script gathered information from my AWS account about S3 public-access settings, security group rules, RDS public accessibility, and EBS encryption. It produced PASS, WARN, or FAIL results without changing any AWS resources.

* **Analyze:** Claude Code analyzed the audit report, explained the security and potential cost risks of the findings, and recommended appropriate remediation steps.

* **Human Act:** I manually applied the remediation in a separate terminal. The change was scoped to my own IP address rather than allowing access from the entire internet.

* **Verify:** I ran the audit script again after making the change. The second audit confirmed that the finding had been resolved.

The remediation command must always be run by me and never automatically by Claude because the audit and AI analysis are intentionally **read-only**. This separation prevents an AI tool from making potentially destructive or security-sensitive changes to my AWS infrastructure without human approval. It also ensures that I remain responsible for reviewing the recommendation, deciding whether the change is appropriate, and applying it safely.✅
